"""
Write a program that reads numbers until a user enters 55. Once 55 is entered, stop reading the input, print out how many numbers have been entered,
their total sum, and average (do the rounding this way: round(number)).
Do NOT include 55 in your calculations and print each resulting value on a new line in the order given above.
